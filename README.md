# Anonymous Code Repository for "Dynamically Scaled Temperature in Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning"
## Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence

- smallscale directory contains the code to reproduce our results on CIFAR datasets
- imagenet directory contains code to reproduce our results on ImageNet100 and ImageNet1K datasets
- SimCSE directory contains the code from the original repository with the same name, modified to incorporate DySTreSS and MACL.

- SimCSE codes were run on NVIDIA A5500 GPU
- smallscale codes were run on NVIDIA 2080Ti
- experiments on ImageNet100 codes were run on NVIDIA P100 GPU
- experiments on ImageNet1K were run on NVIDIA A5000 GPU
